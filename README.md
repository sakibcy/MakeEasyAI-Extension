### This is a template to build Browser Extension with React JS, also Tailwind is added.
#### If we don't need the newTab feature, then from the manifest.json file remove "chrome_url_overrides" section.

#### Also if we don't need something then just delete the folder from 'src' and also remove specific lines from manifest.json
